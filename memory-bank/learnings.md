### [CURRENT_DATE] - Framework Installation

**Incorrect Assumption**:
Starting development without a structured workflow framework

**Correct Approach**:
Use CursorRIPER Framework for structured development with persistent memory

## How to Add Learnings

Use the `/learn` command with this format:
```
/learn "incorrect assumption" "correct approach" "reasoning/context"
```

Example:
```
/learn "implementing without planning" "use /plan before /execute" "planning prevents mistakes and ensures quality"
```
